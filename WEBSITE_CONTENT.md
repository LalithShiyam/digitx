Headline: Shaping Health Intelligence

Body:
Healthcare generates extraordinary amounts of information — clinical notes, diagnostic reports, procedures, labs, timelines — yet most of it is not truly usable. It isn’t structured. It isn’t linked. It isn’t computable.

Without structure, there is no reasoning.
Without reasoning, there is no intelligence.

DIGITX works on the foundations of health intelligence:
systems that transform messy clinical data into structured, connected, computable knowledge.

VISION SECTION

Label: Our Vision

Headline: From Raw Data to Computable Knowledge

Body:
Our vision is simple but ambitious:
to build the infrastructure that turns real-world healthcare data into something machines can reason about — and humans can trust.

We do not believe health intelligence begins with building ever-larger multimodal models.
We believe it begins with understanding what the data actually says, how different pieces relate, and how they fit into the causal fabric of health and disease.

We aim to create systems where:
	•	clinical data structures itself,
	•	knowledge graphs capture the meaning behind it,
	•	and clinicians can interact with this knowledge in ways that are grounded, explainable, and clinically safe.

This is the substrate on which true health intelligence can grow.

WHY DIGITX EXISTS

Label: The Problem We Take Seriously

Headline: Healthcare is data rich but insight poor.

Body:
Most clinical information exists in formats that resist computation:
free text, incompatible systems, isolated modalities, and fragmented patient timelines.

Researchers spend months preparing datasets before they can ask a single meaningful question.
Clinicians face information overload without the tools to interpret it.
AI systems try to learn from unstructured chaos and end up brittle, opaque, or untrustworthy.

We think the future of healthcare depends on something upstream:
turning clinical data into structured, linkable, computable knowledge that supports reasoning, not just prediction.

DIGITX exists to build that foundation.

FOCUS AREAS

Label: What We Work On
Headline: Foundations for Health Intelligence

We focus on a small number of foundational challenges that must be solved before healthcare can benefit from trustworthy, scalable intelligence.

⸻

1. Autonomous Structuring of Clinical Data

We develop systems that transform raw clinical inputs — notes, reports, sequences, labs — into consistent, machine-understandable structure.

2. Knowledge Graphs as a Common Substrate

Once structured, data becomes far more useful when connected.
We build knowledge graphs that express clinical relationships, temporal patterns, and contextual links.
This substrate forms the backbone for reasoning, decision support, and evidence generation.

3. Reasoning Interfaces for Clinicians and Researchers

We design ways for people to interact with structured knowledge safely and intuitively.
LLM-based interfaces help retrieve information and explain relationships — always anchored in traceable evidence rather than ungrounded predictions.

4. Scalable Infrastructure for Health Evidence

Once data is structured and connected, it becomes possible to study health at scale.
We build the infrastructure that allows researchers and clinicians to run analyses across thousands of datasets, not just a curated few.

Our aim is to make large-scale, reproducible health evidence generation a normal, accessible part of clinical research — not a privileged exception.

HOW WE WORK

Label: How We Work
Headline: Honest Methods for a Complex Domain

⸻

Principle 1 — Begin with Clinical Reality

Healthcare data is messy, incomplete, and heterogeneous.
We design methods grounded in real workflows and real constraints.

⸻

Principle 2 — Structure Enables Intelligence

We prioritize explicit structure, semantics, and clarity.
Reasoning and causality require more than predictions — they require meaning.

⸻

Principle 3 — LLMs Are Tools, Not Oracles

We use large language models where they help, but we always ground them in structured knowledge and verification.
Their outputs should be traceable, explainable, and adjustable.

⸻

Principle 4 — Reproducibility and Scale Matter

A method that only works on a curated dataset is not enough.
We aim for systems that generalize across institutions, populations, and thousands of datasets.

⸻

Principle 5 — Quiet Ambition

We work on foundational problems that take time.
We approach them with humility, curiosity, and a commitment to rigor.

PEOPLE SECTION

Label: People
Headline: A Small, Interdisciplinary Lab

DIGITX is based at LMU Klinikum Munich and brings together clinicians, informaticians, engineers, and researchers who care about building the upstream foundations of health intelligence.

We value clarity over hype, rigor over shortcuts, and thoughtful progress over noise.

Opportunities:
We welcome:
	•	students seeking research projects,
	•	clinicians with ideas or frustrations around data use,
	•	collaborators from medicine, computer science, and informatics,
	•	partners interested in building trustworthy health intelligence.
